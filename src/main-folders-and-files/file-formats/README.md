## Binary files

___

### About

This article is an introduction to binary files.

Before reading the other articles in the "[File Formats](index.html)" category, you should read this one first.

### Structure

In binary files, bytes are represented in reverse order.

For example, the number 0x12345678 in a file would look like this: 78 56 34 12.

### Data types

Let's introduce the notation of data types.

These notations will be used in other articles.

| Designation | Type | Range | Size (bytes) |
---|---|---|---|
| B | Integer | 0 ... 255 | 1 |
| H | Integer | 0 ... 65535 | 2 |
| I | Integer | 0 ... 4294967295 | 4 |
| i | Integer | -2147483648 ... 2147483647 | 4 |
| f | Fractional number | - | 4 |
| s | String | - | - |

In some files a value may not be stored in the whole byte, but only part of it (e.g. 4 bits).

As a result, one byte will store two values.

In articles about binary files, sizes will be specified either in bits or in bytes.

Strings necessarily have a null byte at the end, which indicates that the string has ended. For example: "test_string0x0".

As a result, the length of the string is equal to the number of characters in it + 1 (null byte).

### Blocks

In X-Ray, some binary files are in [RIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format) format.

Such files have blocks (also called chunks or sections).

A block is binary data with a header.

Block structure

| Data | Type |
---|---|
| Identifier | H |
| Compression | H |
| Content size (bytes) | I |
| Content | Binary data |

You can see from the identifier what is stored in a particular block.

If the compression is set to 0x0000, the block is uncompressed, and if it is set to 0x8000, the block is compressed by the [Huffman method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

You can use a program from xray_re_tools (trunk\garbage\lzhuf\lzhuf.c) to decompress compressed blocks.

In the files of the final version of the game most blocks are uncompressed.

The size of the block content indicates only the number of bytes of data (not including identifier, compression and size bytes).

Binary block data can be represented by nested blocks.

# bump#.dds #

___

## About ##

Corrects DXT compression errors in [.bump](bump.md)

## Technical information ##

### Format ##

- RGB - Error correction for normal map (bump.dds) - Not necessary if you're using good quality normal map. It's generated with SDK
- A - height map; used for parallax, if the use of it was turned on when setting up the texture

### The engine currently supports the following compressions ##

- DXT5
- BC7

___

## Can be generated by ##

- [Bump Generator](../../modding-tools/bump-generator.md)
- [SDK 0.7](../../sdk/index.html)

___

# bump.dds

___

## About

The bump map is a regular normal map in A(BGR) format (typical for DXT5_nm compression format). The developers used this order for a very simple reason - DXT compression "spoils" the texture much less, since the alpha channel is not subjected to compression and remains almost in its original form.

## Technical information

### Format

- R - Glossiness (Glossiness, aka inverted roughness. It works best in stalker, and allows for using better BRDF)
- G - Normal Z (Unused in Anomaly 1.6.0)
- B - Normal Y (DIRECTX format.)
- A - Normal X

### The engine currently supports the following compressions

- DXT5
- BC7

## Technical information

- Format version: 3

### General structure - file blocks

It consists of three [RIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format) sections (blocks):

| Block ID | Size (bytes) | Description |
---|---|---|
| 0x0 | 24 | headline |
| 0x1 | - | object models (in [.dm](dm.md) format) |
| 0x2 | - | table of 2x2 meter cells, setting the density and species diversity of objects on the map |

Block order in version 3: 0x1, 0x2, 0x0

One cell (slot) is a parallelepiped.

The dimensions of all cells along the X and Z axes are the same and equal to 2 meters.

The height of the slot (the dimensions of the parallelepiped along the Y axis) in all the slots is individual.

![level-details-slot-in-level-editor centered](images/Level_details_slot_in_level_editor.png)

slot in the Level Editor

### Blocks

#### Block 0x0 (header)

| Type | Description |
---|---|
| I | format version |
| I | number of dm models in the file |
| i | offset of the table cells along the X axis |
| i | offset of the table cells along the Z axis|
| I | the number of table cells on the X axis |
| I | the number of table cells on the Z axis |

#### Block 0x1 (meshes)

A block consists of nested blocks.

The nested block identifier is the mesh index of the detailed object.

Nested block data is a mesh in .dm format

#### Block 0x2 (slots/cell table)

The block stores cells (slots).

The slots in this block are written alternately.

Up to four meshes of detailed objects can be attached to each slot.

The mesh index of a detailed object can be in the range [0 ... 62] (63 is no mesh).

One slot's data is stored in 16 bytes (128 bits), which store the following:

| Size (in bits) | Description |
---|---|
| 12 | Coordinate of the bottom edge of the slot on the Y axis (this value should be multiplied by 0.2 meters) |
| 8 | Height of the slot (this value should be multiplied by 0.1 meter) |
| 6 | Identifier of the first mesh of vegetation |
| 6 | Identifier of the second mesh of vegetation |
| 6 | Identifier of the third mesh of vegetation |
| 6 | Identifier of the fourth mesh of vegetation |
| 4 | Shade from the sun |
| 4 | Hemi lighting |
| 4 | Red component of static light sources |
| 4 | Green component of static light sources |
| 4 | Blue component of static light sources |
| 4 | Density of the first mesh in the left front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the first mesh in the right front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the first mesh in the left rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the first mesh in the right rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the second mesh in the left front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the second mesh in the right front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the second mesh in the left rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the second mesh in the right rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the third mesh in the left front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the third mesh in the right front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the third mesh in the left rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the third mesh in the right rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the fourth mesh in the left front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the fourth mesh in the right front corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the fourth mesh in the left rear corner of the slot |
| 4 | Density of the fourth mesh in the right rear corner of the slot |

As you can see from the table, each slot has 16 density values.

Each of the four meshes has four density values (for the four corners of the slot).

The density values within a slot are interpolated from the density values of the slot corners.

Let us denote the densities as follows:

- a0 - density for the left front corner of the slot

- a1 - density for the right front corner of the slot

- a2 - density for the left rear corner of the slot

- a3 - density for the right rear corner of the slot

If you look at the slot from above, the densities will look like this:

![level-details-slot-density-example centered](images/Level_details_slot_density_example.png)

Mesh density, slot view from above

Restrictions are imposed on the position of slots along the Y axis.

The lower limit is -200 meters.

And the allowed range: from -200 meters to 619 meters (0.2 * 4095 - 200).

The maximum height of the slot (parallelepiped) is: 25.5 (0.1 * 255).

The upper boundary of the slot is equal to: the lower boundary + the height of the slot.

> A few words about the vertex format. As you already know, there are several vertex description blocks in the file. Not all objects in the game are the same: you have to specify coordinates of lightmaps for brushes, and coordinates of textures for trees can be simplified. Therefore, vertices specified in different blocks may be different. The vertex format is specified using several structures - this is the standard D3D vertex buffer format. That is, the file contains ready assembled vertex buffers for D3D:

|  | Value | Size |
---|---|---|
| ???(always zero) | 0 | Word(2) |
| Offset | - | Word(2) |
| Type of variables | - | Word(2) |
| What the variables describe | - | Word(2) |

> At the very beginning of any vertex are the coordinates of its placement, so the vertex format does not include a description of the coordinates. There are only three vertex formats in the 2215 maps:

# .hom (Hierarchical Occlusion Mapping)

___

## About

HOM is a geometry cutter, which is a mesh and is needed to increase performance. This file is created during level compilation.

## Technical information

### Blocks

Consists of two blocks:

| Block ID | Size (bytes) | Description |
---|---|---|
| 0x0 | 4 | header (contains information about the format version) |
| 0x1 | number of polygons * 40 | vertex coordinates and polygon properties |

### Block description

#### Block 0x0 (header)

| Type | Description |
---|---|
| I | format version |

#### Block 0x1 (mesh data)

Contains the data of the triangles, which are written one by one.

The data is for one triangle:

| Type | Description |
---|---|
| fff | 3D coordinates of the first vertex of the triangle |
| fff | 3D coordinates of the second vertex of the triangle |
| fff | 3D coordinates of the third vertex of the triangle |
| I | two sided option |

Possible values of the "two sided" option: 0x0, 0x1

The polygon indices are not saved, but they can easily be generated, since all vertices are saved so that the polygon indices are in ascending order.

The first triangle will be: 0, 1, 2, second: 3, 4, 5, third: 6, 7, 8, etc.

# LTX files

___

## About

LTX files are basically ini files with some custom additions. They are located all over the `gamedata/configs` and are used for, well, configs.

Here's how ltx config might look like:

```ini
#include "tables/gun_*.ltx"

[some_nice_gun]
recoil              = 0.8
boosts              = a, b, c, d    ; list
fancy_feature       = {=is_night()} true, false

[some_other_gun]
...
```

From this example we can see some fancy ltx features:

1. `#include` preprocessor command. This command basically merges the file into this config. Many of the configs are included into `system.ltx` this way, so you can access almost all sections through `ini_sys` handler.
2. Wildcard imports - `*` in include statement corresponds to any text, so the given include will include both `gun_ak.ltx` and `gun_m4.ltx`. This feature was developed for Anomaly, so you may not find it in other mods.
3. Name of the section in square brackets - this is referred in scripts as `section_name` or just `section`.
4. Key-value pairs. Values may include comma-separated lists.
5. Comments start with `;`.
6. `fancy_feature` uses something called "condlist". Refer to [condlists manual](../../configs/condlists.md) to understand this bs.

# .object

___

## About

These files are intended for the X-Ray SDK to store 3D content in its original, uncompressed, lossless form. They are source files that store information before compilation into other game compressed formats.

## Technical information

### The format can store the following basic data (the list is not complete)

- meshes
- materials
- bones
- skeleton animations

### Possibilities and limitations of the .object format

One *.object file can store:

- one or more meshes if it has no skeleton and only one meshes if it has a skeleton
- one or more materials
- a skeleton can be absent, or it can hold at least one
- a skeleton can store a minimum of 1, a maximum of 64 bones (for X-Ray SDK 0.4)
- skeleton animations may not be present, or one or more animations may be stored
- skeleton animations do not support Scale keys
- each mesh can have one or more materials
- each mesh must have one UV scan
- each material can store only one texture

# .omf (Open Motions Format)

___

## About

A specialized S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game format containing animations. This is a separate dedicated file used in conjunction with .ogf models. Was created in order to optimize process when some different models use the same list of animations.

## Technical information

They are in [RIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format) format. That is, the file is divided into chunks.
The omf file consists of two chunks:

- 0xE - stores animations (rotation, movement of bones)

- 0xF - stores the Bone Parts and animation parameters.

These chunks can be found inside the ogf files.
In other words, an omf file is a slice of an ogf file that is moved to an external file.
The structure of the 0xE and 0xF chunks in ogf is identical to those in omf.

### The structure of the 0xE chunk

This chunk consists of nested chunks.
The first nested chunk is the one with the identifier 0x0.
The zero chunk stores an unsigned 32-bit integer number.
This number indicates the number of animations in the omf file.
The identifier of each subsequent chunk is one more than the previous one.
That is, 0x0 is followed by 0x1, then 0x2, 0x3, etc.
All the chunks following 0x0 contain animations.
Description of the nested chunk that stores the animations
The animation name comes first, which is a string ending with a null byte.
Next is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which specifies the number of animation frames.
The following data is the dice transforms. For each bone, rotation, movement, and flags are stored.
Flags come first. Flags is an unsigned 8 bit integer.
The first bit of this byte indicates if the movement is modifiable.
If the bit is 1, then the movement has values throughout all frames.
If the bit is 0, then the movement has only one value for the entire animation interval.
This is done to optimize it so that it doesn't store a bunch of identical keys, but instead has a single value.
The second bit of this byte indicates whether the rotation is static (not changing throughout the animation).
The third bit is the High Quality flag. If it is 0, then the position has an 8-bit representation, otherwise it is 16-bit.
Next comes the information about the rotation.
What will be written to the file next depends on the flags.
If the second bit of the flag is 0, the file will contain the following:
One rotation value as a quaternion with two-byte signed components.
That is, QXYZ, each 2 bytes, for a total of 8 bytes.
And if the second bit of the flag is 1, then the following follows:
crc32 sum as a 4 byte unsigned integer.
And after that come the rotation quaternion values for each frame.
The format of rotation is the same as described above (the same 8 bytes).
Now comes the movement information.
If the first bit of the flag is 1, then follows a 32-bit unsigned integer, which is the crc32 sum.
This is followed by three eight-bit numbers, which indicate the position of the bone on the x, y, z axes.
These positions are written for each frame.
That is, the positions should be read in a loop, which is repeated as many times as the number of frames contains the animation.
After all these positions are data about the initial conditions of movement:
Amplitude or size of movement.
These are three float numbers (4 bytes each).
And then there is the initial value of movement. These are also 3 float numbers.
These initial conditions are stored in a single instance for each bone in this animation.
That is, these values do not change throughout the animation.
If the first bit of the flag is 0, there is one move value for all frames.
This movement is stored in 3 float numbers (4 bytes each).

Below is a pseudocode that describes one animation:

```C++
name = string
length = uint32
for bone in bones {
    flags = uint8
    translate_present = flags(0)    // get bit 0
    rotate_absent = flags(1)    // get bit 1
    high_quality = flags(2)    // get bit 2
    if rotate_absent {
        quaternion = int16, int16, int16, int16    // Q, X, Y, Z
    } else {
        motion_crc32 = int32
        for (i=0, i<length, i++) {
            quaternion = int16, int16, int16, int16    // Q, X, Y, Z
        }
    }
    if translate_present {
        motion_crc32 = int32
        if high_quality {
            for (i=0, i<length, i++) {
                translation = int16, int16, int16    // X, Y, Z
            }
        } else {
            for (i=0, i<length, i++) {
                translation = int8, int8, int8    // X, Y, Z
            }
        }
        translate_size = float, float, float    // X, Y, Z
        translate_init = float, float, float    // X, Y, Z
    } else {
        translate = float, float, float    // X, Y, Z
    }
```

### Chunk structure 0xF

Stores bone parts and animation parameters.
The code that describes this chunk is shown below:

```C++
params_version = uint16 // parameter format version
partition_count = uint16 // number of bone parts
for (i=0, i<partition_count, i++) {
    partition_name = string // name of the bone part
    bone_count = uint16 // number of bones in this bone part
    for (j=0, j<bone_count, j++) {
        if params_version == 3 {
            bone_name = string // bone name
            bone_id = uint32 // bone ID
        }
    }
    motion_count = uint16 // number of animations
    for (j=0, i<motion_count, j++) {
        // animation parameters
        motion_name = string
        motion_flags = uint32
        bone_or_part = uint16
        motion = uint16 // animation identifier from the 0xE chunk
        speed = float32
        power = float32
        accrue = float32
        falloff = float32
    }
}
```

# .seq (Sequence)

___

## About

Text file that is used to create a simple animation texture, by recording a sequence of "frames" and a playback speed.

## Example

```example
15
ui\ui_ani_cursor_01
ui\ui_ani_cursor_02
ui\ui_ani_cursor_03
ui\ui_ani_cursor_04
ui\ui_ani_cursor_05
```

Order in which the textures are played will be 1234512312312345

```example
cycled
15
ui\ui_ani_cursor_01
ui\ui_ani_cursor_02
ui\ui_ani_cursor_03
ui\ui_ani_cursor_04
ui\ui_ani_cursor_05
```

In this case, because of "cycled" the playback order will be 1234543212345432123454321
Speed of texture change is set in numerical format before the enumeration

The number of textures in the list is arbitrary, but the more frames, the greater the load on the engine, respectively.
The name of the file is set by the name of the assigned texture (without taking the extension into account). If there is a *[.dds](dds.md) file in the folder with the same name as the *.seq file, the engine ignores the original texture, giving priority to the *.seq file. The priority of file search by extension is as follows:

- .ogm
- .avi
- .seq
- [.dds](dds.md)

## Parameters

- The "cycled" parameter is optional if you want to loop from the first texture to the last texture and from the last texture to the first texture.
If you don't write it, it will play in a normal circular loop.
- Playback speed (frames per second) (written before the list of textures)

# .som (Sound Occluder Mesh)

___

## About

Geometry for calculating sound propagation. Used to allow sound to pass through walls, ceilings, floors, etc. with varying strength.

## Technical information

- Format version: 0

### Blocks

It consists of two blocks:

| Block ID | Size (bytes) | Description |
---|---|---|
| 0x0 | 4 | header (contains information about the format version) |
| 0x1 | polygon count * 44 | vertex coordinates and polygon properties |

The structure of the file is similar to .hom

#### Block 0x0 (header)

| Type | Description |
---|---|
| I | format version |

#### Block 0x1 (mesh data)

| Тип | Description | Note | Note 2 |
---|---|---|---|
| fff | 3D coordinates of the first vertex of the triangle | - | - |
| fff | 3D coordinates of the second vertex of the triangle | - | - |
| fff | 3D coordinates of the third vertex of the triangle | - | - |
| I | "two sided" option | Possible values of the "two sided" option: 0x0, 0x1 | If 0x1, the polygon will cut off sound from both sides, and if 0x0, it will only cut off sound from the front side |
| f | "Sound Occlusion" parameter | The "Sound Occlusion" parameter specifies how much of the sound volume will be heard. The value depends on the material of the SOM object before compilation. | The value of this parameter is prescribed in the materials and can be found in Shader Editor>Material>Item Properties>Factors>Sound Occlusion (Possible values are 0.0 - 1.0) |

Polygon indices are not saved, but they can be easily generated, because all vertices are saved so that polygon indices are in ascending order.

The first triangle will be: 0, 1, 2, second: 3, 4, 5, third: 6, 7, 8, etc.

# .thm

___

## About

They are used to set the parameters of [.dds](dds.md) textures - [bump](bump.md), [detail](detail-map.md), and more. Without them the game does not give textures the necessary parameters, and therefore they are obtained "flat", worse than the static lighting.

# XML files

___

## About

XML files are used to save text strings used for translation. All XML files are located in `gamedata/configs/text/*lang*`. XML files have these properties:

1. They are saved in encoding Windows-1251. English translation won't break if you're using UTF, but russian will.
2. Every string must have an unique id assigned to it.
3. There is a single namespace for all xml files of one language. That means, no matter in which file you are saving your strings, they will be available in one place, namely `game.translate_string(*id*)`.

XML file will look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1251"?>
<string_table>
	<string id="nice_text_id">
		<text>Cool text inside text tags</text>
	</string>

    <string id="another_text_id">
		<text>...</text>
	</string>
    
    ...
</string_table>
```
